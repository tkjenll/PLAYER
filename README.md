PLAYER.ME NEED UPDATED TO STREAM AND TIPS 
https://blog.player.me/player-desktop-app-update-fcca57746a3c

As you know, a couple of years ago we released the Player.me desktop app to help gamers around the world create content around the games they love playing. It was a project we spent years working on and ultimately the vision of effectively combining a community platform with great live streaming and recording tools was something that was just that little bit out of our reach. We’ve never felt that we managed to get the mix really right.
So, we’ve made the difficult decision to shut down our desktop application and no longer support it. I know this will disappoint a lot of you who use our app every day, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel…and it’s called Gamecaster!

Gamecaster’s rewards program
A few years ago some of the Player team and some of the XSplit team banded together to focus on building the ultimate, dedicated streaming and recording app for gamers with Gamecaster. For the last 2 years they’ve been working hard and have built a truly awesome content creator application with tons of additional features that will help you grow your audience. They’ve also just launched their first Season Pass with tons of amazing prizes for hitting some of your streaming goals so we thought it was the perfect time to recommend their app. And, the good news is it’s 100% FREE and always will be.
As for Player, we’re still weighing up our options for the future. Step 1 for us is to move back towards our roots of being a platform for you to create your gaming profile and discover and connect with players, games and communities. With that in mind we do have a couple of sneaky updates coming down the tracks so you should follow our Twitter to get some more sneak peeks at those.
Tl;dr: The Player.me desktop has been deprecated and we recommend you switch to Gamecaster to have a much better streaming and recording experience.
Thanks for giving our app a try and hopefully we’ll still see you on the feed!
